# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to our Data Structures and Algorithms course! You may or may not have
seen this course on Canvas as well during your time in the program. This repo
is set up to give you easy access to the material from this course upon graduation
so you can continue working and prepare for technical interviews.

## Setup

**Fork and clone** this repository to get started! All the lessons for this
course are contained in separate folders in this repo. Use the
[Course Roadmap](#course-roadmap) at the bottom of this page to navigate and
track your progress.

## How to Progress Through This Course

This course is split up so that you can devote 30 to 60 minutes each day to a
new algorithm problem. You are welcome to move through the material faster if
you have time to do so. Like learning anything, consistency is key, so make sure
you have a plan for approaching this material and stick to it!

We recommend approaching these problems in order by yourself since each problem
increases in difficulty. For a problem that is meant to be solved on the same
day, work on it for 30 minutes. If you can’t solve it in 30 minutes, work on
something else, and then come back to it and give yourself up to 30 more
minutes. For problems that are meant to be solved over the course of several
days, set aside 30 to 60 minutes each day to work on them. If you reach the time
limit and have not solved the problem, look at our solution or someone else's
and take time to understand why it works.

For any type of problem, if you were able to pass most of the test cases but
just can’t quite solve a couple of the edge cases, consider looking for a
solution to compare yours to. If we provide a solution, you can compare it to
ours, but you can also ask other students and search the Internet. Take the time
to understand why the solutions work and consider working on your solution until
it works given what you’ve learned.

## Some Things to Keep in Mind

You may struggle with some or many of these problems. Be patient with yourself
and trust that with time and practice, you’ll improve. You’ll be amazed at how
much you progress with each week or month!

If you look at other solutions, be aware that shorter doesn’t mean better. Aim
for a solution that makes sense to you, which you can also explain to others.
Three lines of easy-to-understand code is better than one line of confusing
code.

If you use an online platform that provides information on how fast your code
runs or how well it utilizes memory, take that information with a giant grain of
salt. Many of those platforms do not tell you how they arrive at those results,
and you may find that the results vary greatly even when running the same code.
You might also find that someone with a similar solution to yours has wildly
different performance results - an indication that the platform isn’t
calculating results correctly.

Lastly, try not to compare yourself to others at this point. Everyone progresses
at a different pace, and that’s OK. The key is to keep trying while taking care
of yourself mentally and physically.
