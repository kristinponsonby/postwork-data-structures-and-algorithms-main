# Day 5: Find a Target Value in a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the node with the target value and return the node. If the node does not exist in the tree return a falsy value, such as `null` or `nil`.

```
   1
  / \
-1   2

Input: root node, target = 2
Output: Node with value 2

Input: root node, target = 5
Output: null or nil
```

What is the time complexity of your solution? How does the complexity differ for a balanced tree versus an unbalanced tree?

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

## How to run your own tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `ruby <filename>.rb`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `node <filename>.js`

## How to run our tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `bundle install`
3. `rspec`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `npm i`
3. `npm test`
