# Whiteboard Big O

## Introduction

For this activity, you and your partner will take turns calculating the time
complexity using Big O notation for a problem you solved previously. Think of
this exercise as being more collaborative and less formal than other
whiteboarding exercises. In other words, you and your partner should communicate
freely and work together to come up with the appropriate calculation.

## Instructions

- You and your partner should each choose a different problem that you've
  already solved
- Share your solution to the chosen problem either on a whiteboard or via a
  screenshare
- Determine the time complexity for your solution
  - Explain your thinking and work with your partner to come up with the answer
  - Take turns typing or whiteboarding
    - Plan to start the conversation and whiteboard/type when evaluating your
      own solution
  - Remember to use the correct notation, e.g. O(n) or O(1)
