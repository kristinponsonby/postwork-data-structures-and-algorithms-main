# Day 3-5: Add Two Numbers - List Nodes

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

### Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

### Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100]- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

## How to run your own tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `ruby <filename>.rb`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `node <filename>.js`

## How to run our tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `bundle install`
3. `rspec`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `npm i`
3. `npm test`
