# Day 1-2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

### Example 2:

Input: s = "pwwkew"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Example 3:

Input: s = ""

Output: 0

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

**BONUS**: For students who did not achieve O(n) on longest substring, refactor solution until achieved.

## How to run your own tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `ruby <filename>.rb`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `node <filename>.js`

## How to run our tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `bundle install`
3. `rspec`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `npm i`
3. `npm test`
