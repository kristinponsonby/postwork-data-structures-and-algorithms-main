# Bonus Algorithm: Recursive Reverse a String

For this task, you'll need to reverse a string...**recursively**! Your method will receive one argument, a string, and be expected to output that string with its letters in reverse order.

```
Input: "hi"
Output: "ih"

Input: "catbaby"
Output: "ybabtac"
```

**Do not call any type of built-in reverse method!**

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

## How to run your own tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `ruby <filename>.rb`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `node <filename>.js`

## How to run our tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `bundle install`
3. `rspec`

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `npm i`
3. `npm test`
