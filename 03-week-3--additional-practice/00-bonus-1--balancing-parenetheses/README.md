# Bonus 1: Balancing Parentheses

For parentheses to be considered balanced, there must an opening parenthesis followed by a matching closing parenthesis. Given a string containing only parentheses, return the number of additional parentheses needed for the string to be considered balanced. The input string will have a minimum length of 1.

```
Input: '(()())'
Output: 0

Input: '()))'
Output: 2

Input: ')'
Output: 1
```

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**
