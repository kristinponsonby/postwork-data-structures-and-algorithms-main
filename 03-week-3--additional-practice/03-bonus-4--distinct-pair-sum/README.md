# Bonus 4: Distinct Pair Sum

Given an input Array and a target value `k`, return all distinct pairs of consecutive numbers that add up to `k`. A pair is distinct if no other pair contains the same numbers. The order of the pairs and order of the values in each pair does not matter, e.g. we consider [[2, 8], [7, 3]] to be the same as [[3, 7], [8, 2]].

```
Input: [0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1], 2
Output: [[1, 1], [2, 0]]

Input: [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 2, 8, 2], 10
Output: [[2, 8]]
```

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

## How to run your own tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `ruby <filename>.rb`

### JavaScript
