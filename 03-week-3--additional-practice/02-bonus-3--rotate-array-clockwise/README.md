# Bonus 3: Rotate Array Clockwise

Given an input Array, rotate `k` units clockwise, i.e. shift the values rightward `k` units.

`k` is an Integer >= 0.

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], 1
Output: [4, 1, 2, 3]

Input: [1, 2, 3], 2
Output: [2, 3, 1]

Input: [1, 2, 3], 3
Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**
